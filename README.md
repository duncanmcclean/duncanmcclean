## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Duncan](https://duncanmcclean.com), a software developer from Glasgow, Scotland. I primarily work with Laravel, Statamic, Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.

For better or for worse, I've been attached to computers since I could read. I "built" my first website when I was five - messing around with HTML in a WYSIWYG. 

After many years of helping out in the Statamic Discord, building addons, triaging issues and contributing to Core, I joined [joined the Statamic team](https://statamic.com/blog/duncan-mcclean) in late 2023.

Outside my day job, I've always got a few side projects on the go. Right now I'm working on:

* [Cargo](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/statamic-cargo) - A comprehensive e-commerce addon for Statamic
* [Runway](https://github.com/statamic-rad-pack/runway) - Allows you to manage Eloquent models from the Statamic Control Panel
* A webhook tunnel built using Laravel Reverb. I shared an [early prototype](https://duncanmcclean.com/alright-heres-a-demo-of-how-im-using-reverb-outside-of-the-browser) on my blog (_WIP_)
